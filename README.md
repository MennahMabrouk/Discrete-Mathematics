# Discrete-Mathematics

* File format: The files are in a text file format, with each question and answer pair separated under each other.

* File naming convention: The files are named according to the assignment number they correspond to. For example, one file might be named "Assignment One .txt".

* Contents: Each file contains a set of questions and answers based on the corresponding assignment in the textbook "Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications Eighth Edition" by Kenneth H. Rosen. The questions cover various topics such as set theory, logic, graph theory, combinatorics, and more.

* Format: The questions are generally formatted as exercises or problems that require the student to apply their knowledge of the topic. The answers are provided in a separate section or immediately following the question, depending on the file.

* Purpose: The files are intended to be used as study materials for students taking a course in discrete mathematics or using the textbook "Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications Eighth Edition" by Kenneth H. Rosen. The questions and answers provide practice and reinforcement for the concepts covered in the book.

# Projects 
### 1. DiscreteMathematics

This project is a Jupyter Notebook file focused on discrete mathematics.
It likely contains explanations, examples, and exercises related to topics such as logic, sets, relations, functions, combinatorics, and graph theory.

### 1.1Shorter Version

This project appears to be a shortened version of the DiscreteMathematics.ipynb project mentioned above.
It could contain a condensed or summarized version of the original notebook, highlighting the key concepts and important aspects of discrete mathematics.

### 2. Discrete Rules Of Inference

This project is a Python file focusing on the implementation of discrete rules of inference.
It likely contains code that demonstrates various logical inference rules used in discrete mathematics.

### 2.1 Discrete Rules Of Inference

This project is a Prolog file related to discrete rules of inference.
Prolog is a logic programming language, so this file likely contains code that implements and demonstrates the application of rules of inference in the Prolog language.

### 3. Cryptography Simple Chat with 2 Users

This project is a Python file that focuses on implementing a simple chat application using cryptography techniques.
It likely includes code that enables two users to securely communicate by encrypting and decrypting their messages.
